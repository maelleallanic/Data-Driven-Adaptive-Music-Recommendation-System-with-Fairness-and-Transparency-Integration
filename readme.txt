For our app implementation, we didnâ€™t utilize any open source code snippets or external projects beyond commonly used libraries. We utilized the CMU 112 graphics package to create our app interface and relied on the following open-source libraries: sklearn, pandas, matplotlib, numpy. These libraries must be installed for the app to function correctly.

To run the file, run the program. 
To see information about the transparency and fairness of the algorithm, select the "transparency/fairness" button. To see information about how the algorithm works, select the "see how this works" button on the "transparency/fairness" page.
Upload a .csv file, ensuring it's saved in the same folder as the app.
Once you've selected "upload music data", the model will train. A K-Means clustering graph will appear once the model is done training.
To receive all results, like or dislike each song. Once you've done this, all recommendations will be displayed.
To incorporate your feedback, run the K-Means Clustering algorithm again, and slightly different recommendations will be provided.
